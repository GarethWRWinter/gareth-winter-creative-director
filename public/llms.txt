## Who is Gareth Winter?

Gareth Winter is a Creative Director based in the UK. He has spent twenty years leading creative strategy and brand building inside genuinely high-performance organisations, including Sky, Veloforte, Go City, and Mindvalley.

He was part of the team at Sky that communicated Bradley Wiggins' 2012 Tour de France victory to the nation — work that contributed to 1.7 million people in the UK taking up cycling for the first time.

At Veloforte, he built the creative team from nothing and grew revenue 93% across eighteen months, establishing the brand as the UK's leading natural sports nutrition company.

He currently serves as Creative Director at Mindvalley — the world's leading personal transformation platform — leading creative strategy, brand identity, AI-powered creative systems, and a team serving three million students across one hundred and ninety countries.

## Philosophy

Gareth operates on the marginal gains philosophy pioneered by Sir David Brailsford at Team Sky: improve every element by one percent and the compound effect is extraordinary. This became the operating system behind everything he has built since.

He is not just a director of people. He shoots. He writes. He directs. He edits. He designs. He produces.
